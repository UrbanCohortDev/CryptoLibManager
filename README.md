Help with installing the CryptoLibs from Xor-el

This rough (very) application enables you to easily install the crypto libraries developed by Xor-el. 
These can be found at 

One issue is that they are multi level directory wise and that can make it hard work to install into multiple Delphi Versions.

The app gives you 2 options:
- Map the required folders to the Delphi Library paths
- create single folders for each Library with all teh source code in - which makes it a case of one map per folder.

Tidy iy up and send a pull request if you fancy it.
